### The Game Project - University of London, Intro to Programming I, April 2021 - September 2021

##### Hello and welcome to my final game project developed for the final assignment of the module Intro to Programming I !

The game is developed entirely with vanilla Javascript using the P5.js library, and consist in a basic 2D side-scrolling game, based on the Japanese cartoon character Doraemon, which was designed using p5.js drawing library.

The game contains all the extensions required by the review criteria and for which are provided courseâ€™s lectures, which are:

- Sounds (Edited and Mixed with Logic Pro X)
- Enemies (Basic enemies moving back and forth)
- Platforms (Fixed and moving platforms)

Although its a simply project with really basic functionalities and simple design as a videogame can be, I have been focusing mainly on delivering a final result as much polished as possible, working to make it graphic appealing and altogether fully functional in all its extensions.

As a first time programming project, I am satisfied with this first version, and in future I will improve the level design with the scope of implementing more complex functions, adding more detailed graphics in order to make it looks more similar to a real video game.

The things I enjoyed the most:

- Learning how to program the main basic logics and functionalities behind a videogame project;
- Using different technics and methods to better implement each of the extension that are implemented in the entire program;
- Developing and building a critical thinking to deal with debugging code, and learn to accept and overcome, first looking difficult task or challenges;
- Implementing sounds for each interaction, such as background music, collectibles sound, enemy sounds, etc.
